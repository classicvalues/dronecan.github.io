# PyDroneCAN

PyDroneCAN is an implementation of UAVCAN stack in [Python](http://python.org), supporting SLCAN and SocketCAN adapters.
It is compatible with Python **2.7** (legacy) and **3.3+** (recommended).
We strongly recommend to use Python 3, because support for Python 2.7 may be dropped in the future.

The latest version of pydronecan can be installed using pip:

```sh
pip install dronecan
```

Please visit the [GitHub page](https://github.com/UAVCAN/pydronecan) for more information about contributing to pydronecan, or view the [tutorials](/Implementations/PyDroneCAN/Tutorials) for user-level documentation.
